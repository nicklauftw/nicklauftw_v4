More like why I started writing because several people told me to and itâ€™s a fun mental exercise. I built a new website for myself that allows for writing blog posts in Markdown using Jekyll and GruntJS, which I'll document the process in another post. I don't consider myself a writer but I've been told that I'm a good writer, which is humbling. I struggled writing papers in high school and college due to a lack of interest in the subject matter and difficulty reaching the arbitrary word count or page minimum but now I enjoy writing user stories and process and documentation as a front end developer. There is something satisfying about transferring my thoughts into keystrokes that can I can share with others, expressing and articulating my ideas. So look forward to me writing an occasional post about user experience, design and front end development.

I hope the more I write, the better I can communicate with my collegues. Jim Coudal of Coudal Partners offers this simple and powerful advice.
